# Stay Alive

Stay Alive is a lightweight desktop application designed to prevent your presence status in Microsoft Teams (or similar apps) from switching to "Away" due to inactivity. It achieves this by simulating periodic key presses in the background.

## Features

- **Prevent away status automatically:** Simulates key presses in the background to keep your status active.
- **Customizable time interval:** Users can set the interval (in seconds) between key presses.
- **Customizable key selection:** Allows choice of function keys (F13 to F24) for simulation.
- **AutoStart support:** Option to launch the app automatically on system startup.
- **System Tray integration:** A tray icon provides quick access to settings and app control.
- **GUI for configuration:** A user-friendly interface to modify the interval, select keys, and enable/disable AutoStart.
- **Config file storage:** Stores all settings in `~/.stay_alive_config.json`.

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows (AutoStart functionality uses Windows Registry).
- **No installation necessary:** The app is portable and requires no additional dependencies.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Launch the application**  
   Download and extract the executable file, then run it. After startup:
   - A tray icon appears in the system tray to indicate that "Stay Alive" is active.
   - The application runs silently in the background.

3. **Save configuration**  
   After making changes, click **Save**. The new settings apply immediately and are stored automatically in the `~/.stay_alive_config.json` file.

4. **Enable AutoStart**  
   When the **AutoStart** option is enabled, the app will automatically start on the next system boot.
